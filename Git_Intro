What is GitHub?
        GitHub is a widely-used Free-to-use cloud Storage platform with version control and many other essential features that specifically helps developers to manage and deploy their projects on GitHub.

Benefits of Using Git
        History Tracking: Git allows you to track every change made in your project, including: who made the change and when it was made.
        Collaboration: Multiple developers can be able work on the same project at the same time, and Git efficiently manages the merging of changes in code.
        Branching and Merging: Git enables developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes and later merge them back into the main codebase.
        Offline Work: Git works offline, which means you can commit changes and work on your project even without an internet connection.

Why use Git?
           Here are some of the reasons why you might want to use Git:

           1.   Track changes to your code
            2.   Collaborate on projects with others
              3.   Maintain an organized code history
                4.    Easily revert to previous versions when needed
                  5.     Release your code efficiently and manage versions
                    6.     Enhance productivity and code integrity in software development.

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) primarily used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
          Goals: Speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
          Command-line tool: Developers interact with Git using commands in their terminal.
          Local installation: Git is installed directly on your system.
          Version control: Git manages source code history, allowing you to track changes over time.

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service that builds upon Git’s functionality. Here’s what you need to know:
               Graphical user interface (GUI): GitHub provides an intuitive web interface for managing repositories.
               Web-based hosting: Your Git repositories are hosted on GitHub’s servers.
              Maintenance: GitHub is maintained by Microsoft.
              Focus: Centralized source code hosting and collaboration.
              User management: GitHub includes built-in user management features.
               Licensing: GitHub offers both a free-tier and pay-for-use options.
               Tool integration: GitHub has an active marketplace for integrating external tools.
                Desktop interfaces: GitHub provides a desktop interface called GitHub Desktop.

In summary, Git is the underlying version control system, while GitHub is the platform that hosts Git repositories, 
      facilitates collaboration, and provides additional features for developers and teams.
